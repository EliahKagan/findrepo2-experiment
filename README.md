# findrepo2-experiment

These are experiments toward a program like
[`findrepo`](https://github.com/EliahKagan/newrepo-findrepo#using-findrepo),
but using
[text-embedding-ada-002](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models)
([OpenAIâ€™s new general purpose text embedding
model](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model/)).

This is in contrast to the custom nonempty-substring frequency vectors
(non-semantic vocabulary-unaware sparse lossless embeddings in an indefinitely
high-dimensional vector space) that `findrepo` uses.

Note that the goal of this repository is not to build the alternative. Rather,
these experiments are to figure out of it makes sense to build it, and whether
(and it what ways) it might do a better job than `findrepo`.
