# findrepo2-experiment

Experiments toward a program like findrepo but using text-embedding-ada-002
(OpenAI's new general purpose text embedding model), instead of the custom
nonempty-substring frequency vectors (non-semantic vocabulary-unaware sparse
lossless embeddings in an indefinitely high-dimensional vector space).
